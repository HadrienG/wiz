# todo for folder qc
* [X] Moving graph function into a report.py file
* [X] Create branch tetra to develop the tetra module

## file bins.py :
None


## file qc.py :
* [X] fixing genome importing file tools.py
* [X] adding window size parameter
* [X] adding auto filter
* [X] adding ignorefilter parameter
* [X] adding auto import folder


## file gc.py :
### extract_value
* [X] Fix the new bug to extract_value
* [X] Fix the filtering function


## file tetra.py :
* [X] Give relative tetra distribution
* [X] calculate metric with euclidian or Manathan distant between some contigs (Chebyshev distance added to compare with the others)
* [ ] Enable the choice of distance calculating method between two sequences (by parameter)
* [X] implementing a multiprocessing method
* [ ] adding args to enable choice of cpu nbr used in this module


## file tools.py :
* [X] bugs when we import file 
* [X] try to import file by file
* [X] \-> try to import group of files # * OK >> Bug here 
* [X] \-> try to import folder of files # * OK >> Bug when we import a folder with a unique file
* [X] \-> check if a gen is not already loaded # * OK
* [ ] \-> Check if file is fasta file # ! important way to not crash the code


## file report.py :
* [ ] Make repport in HTML with jinja2
### Distplot graph :
* [X] Adding information about gc distplot graph
* [X] Fixing the range of the yaxis 
* [X] Fixing ploting bug
### scatterplot graph :
* [X] Changing scatterplot graph in plot graph
* [ ] make a colorgroup with each couple sequence bounds
* [ ] mask name of bound in legend
### tetraplot graph :
* [X] Make a heatmap with proportion in each tetranuc
* [X] Make a heatmap with relative proportion for each tetranucl for each contig # ! Amount of data too large to display numeric values
* [ ] annotate the heatmap and specify the distance calculation method used
* [ ] sort sequence with hclust method



## to devtest task :
* [X] Split the E.coli genome in 100 part to test graphs (same process with S.cerevisiae)
* [X] Make a fake seq fasta to test data representation (A shuffle with the splited sequence from E.coli and S.cerevisiae)
